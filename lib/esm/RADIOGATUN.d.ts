/**
 * This interface documents the API for a hash function. This
 * interface somewhat mimics the standard java.security.MessageDigest class. We do not extend that class in order to provide compatibility with reduced Java implementations such as J2ME. Implementing a java.security.Provider compatible with Sun's JCA ought to be easy.
 *
 * A Digest object maintains a running state for a hash function computation. Data is inserted with update() calls; the result is obtained from a digest() method (where some final data can be inserted as well). When a digest output has been produced, the object is automatically reset, and can be used immediately for another digest operation. The state of a computation can be cloned with the copy() method; this can be used to get a partial hash result without interrupting the complete computation.
 *
 * Digest objects are stateful and hence not thread-safe; however, distinct Digest objects can be accessed concurrently without any problem.
